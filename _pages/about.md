<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Yang Zheng (郑扬), currently a first-year Master’s student in USTC-CMI lab, at the School of Cyberspace Security, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by <a href='https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/maozhendong'>Prof. Zhendong Mao</a>. I obtained my B.S. degree in Cyberspace Security (
  









) from University of Science and Technology of China in 2025.

My research interests lie in 3D generation and edit, 4D and world model.
